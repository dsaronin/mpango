Working with PayPal 
##############################################################################

Q: Can I control when PayPal subscription payments are made?

A: No, when you submit our booking form, the PayPal page should include 
a note: "Your subscription will automatically renew at the rates stated 
above unless you cancel prior to the end of the billing period." You can 
cancel this subscription when you choose through PayPal, 
but please let us know too.

Q: Do I have to do anything for my next subscription payment?

A: No, you shouldn't need to do anything to make further monthly 
subscription payments, PayPal will complete the transaction automatically. 
Funds will be drawn from your account first and only fall-back to your 
primary funding source (your bank account, credit or debit card) if necessary. 
If there are any difficulties, the subscription payment should be attempted 
a number of times. In this case PayPal will probably notify you of the problem.

Please let us know if there is likely to be a delay in payment and we will 
keep your text ad running while it is cleared.

Q: How can I cancel my PayPal subscription?

A: To cancel your subscription, log in to the PayPal site at the usual 
address. Click on the History link and go straight to the Advanced Search 
option on the left menu. Copy your subscription ID into the Search for field 
and choose Transaction ID from the drop down selector next to it. Check the 
box next to the Within selector and choose The Past Year.

On the subscription details page, click the Cancel Subscription button at 
the bottom of the page and confirm.

#
#  Using Instant Payment Notification to Track Subscribe Transactions
#  PayPal lets your web server receive messages about Subscribe transactions and
#  payment activity on your account. If you activate Instant Payment 
#  Notification, PayPal sends messages when:  
#  -  Payments are first made, with a status of completed or pending.
#  -  Payments clear, fail, or are denied, if the initial status was pending.
#  -  Subscriptions begin, end, or are canceled, 
#     if you use Subscriptions Password Management.
#
#  How Billing Cycles and Recurring Payments Work
#  
#  PayPal attempts to collect recurring payments from subscribers on the day 
#  after the previous billing cycle or trial period ends. Billing cycles can be 
#  daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, depending on the terms of the original 
#  subscription.
#
#  Working With Modify Subscription Buttons
#
#  Let subscribers modify their active subscriptions by adding a Modify 
#  Subscription button to your website. If you offer different subscriptions 
#  levels, Modify Subscription buttons let you subscribers upgrade to a higher 
#  level without an interruption in service.
#  
#  How PayPal Lets Subscribers Modify Their Subscriptions
#  Modify Subscription buttons let subscribers accept a new set of subscriptions
#  terms and pricing for their current, active subscriptions.
#  
#  You can write the HTML code for Modify Subscription buttons that allow 
#  subscribers to:
#  
#    Modify their active subscriptions, or sign up for new subscriptions
#    Modify their active subscriptions only#
#
#  Working With Unsubscribe Buttons
#  
#  Let subscribers cancel their active subscriptions by adding Unsubscribe 
#  buttons to your website.
#  
#  How PayPal Cancels Subscriptions
#  
#  When subscribers cancel subscriptions, they avoid future recurring payments.
#  If subscribers cancel their subscriptions before payment is sent on the 
#  day that a recurring payment is due, their subscriptions are canceled 
#  immediately and no payments are made.
#  
#  NOTE: Subscribers can cancel their subscriptions from the Subscription 
#  Details pages of their PayPal accounts.
#
#  Reattempting Failed Recurring Payments With Subscribe Buttons
#  
#  PayPal cancels subscriptions when recurring payments fail. A recurring 
#  payment fails if funds cannot be moved from the subscriber’s PayPal account 
#  to your own. Limits on the availability of funds in PayPal accounts occur 
#  rarely, for a variety of reasons.
#  
#  Temporary limits that PayPal places on subscribers’ accounts are often 
#  lifted quickly. To avoid unnecessary cancellations, you can specify that 
#  PayPal should reattempt failed payments before canceling subscriptions.
#  
#  How PayPal Reattempts Failed Recurring Payments
#  
#  PayPal reattempts to collect recurring payments three days after the day 
#  on which recurring payments fail. If the first reattempt to collect a 
#  recurring payment fails, PayPal waits 5 days to reattempt a second time. 
#  If the second reattempt fails, PayPal cancels the subscription.
#  
#  NOTE: Payments made with bank accounts are automatically reattempted 3 days 
#  after PayPal notifies subscribers that their payments failed.  
#  Reattempts will not occur if another subscription payment is scheduled within 
#  14 days of the failed payment, so that payments do not overlap.
