Q: Can I control when PayPal subscription payments are made?

A: No, when you submit our booking form, the PayPal page should include 
a note: "Your subscription will automatically renew at the rates stated 
above unless you cancel prior to the end of the billing period." You can 
cancel this subscription when you choose through PayPal, 
but please let us know too.

Q: Do I have to do anything for my next subscription payment?

A: No, you shouldn't need to do anything to make further monthly 
subscription payments, PayPal will complete the transaction automatically. 
Funds will be drawn from your account first and only fall-back to your 
primary funding source (your bank account, credit or debit card) if necessary. 
If there are any difficulties, the subscription payment should be attempted 
a number of times. In this case PayPal will probably notify you of the problem.

Please let us know if there is likely to be a delay in payment and we will 
keep your text ad running while it is cleared.

Q: How can I cancel my PayPal subscription?

A: To cancel your subscription, log in to the PayPal site at the usual 
address. Click on the History link and go straight to the Advanced Search 
option on the left menu. Copy your subscription ID into the Search for field 
and choose Transaction ID from the drop down selector next to it. Check the 
box next to the Within selector and choose The Past Year.

On the subscription details page, click the Cancel Subscription button at 
the bottom of the page and confirm.
